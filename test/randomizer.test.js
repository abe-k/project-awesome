// We have only written tests for the constructor to Randomizer.
// Randomizer has many methods for providing randomness.
// We decided not to test these methods, for the simple reason that they are random.
// It is certainly possible to do simple tests, only checking (for example) that
//  the values returned are in the correct range.
// However, there are many important properties a random-number generator should have,
//  and testing only a few of them would give a false sense of security:
//  it would provide the illusion that the code is properly tested, without actually providing
//  a guarantee that the random-number generator is working properly.
// To do a full set of proper tests is a monumental undertaking:
//  see for example diehard or the TestU01 suite.
// Since there does not seem to be a Javascript implementation of these tests available,
//  interface to an existing C implementation would be difficult,
//  and creating our own implementation is well outside the scope of this project,
//  we have decided that bad tests are worse than no tests, and so
//  we are not testing the functionality of the Randomizer.
